# signupform

This is a sign-up page modeled after The Odin Projectâ€™s Intermediate HTML and CSS Sign-Up Form lesson. It includes required fields for first name, last name, email, password, and a confirmation field for the password, plus an optional field for your phone number.


I kept with The Odin Project's theme of Norse mythology while giving it a personal spin, focusing on Fenrir instead of Odin.
